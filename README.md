Shopey is a small e-commerce platform designed for both customers and administrators. Customers can browse, filter, and purchase products, while administrators have full control over product management, user management, and more. 

## Tech Stack
I used next js for its SEO feature and more, ts for type safety, next auth for authentication, resend to handle email, stripe for payment and tanstack table cause its headles, works well with tailwind and has awesome documentation. Data fetching are all done in serverside, Mutations are done in server actions with next safe action.
